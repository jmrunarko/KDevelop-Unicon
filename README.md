# KDevelop-Unicon

## Intro
Unicon is a programming language which IMO I found a lot easier to read and write. 
I do programming in Pascal, Fortran, C, C++ and Python, but I felt easier to code in Unicon especially when dealing with string and text processing.

It has 2D, 3D Graphics Library which can be setup with just a view of lines.
It has a lexx and yacc of it's own, socket library and so on.

You can find more information about Unicon on their website:

http://www.unicon.org/

They have many free books at their disposal.

This repo contains the templates and configuration for using Unicon in KDevelop/Kate.

It has:

1. syntax highlighting for Unicon
2. some code snippets for Unicon, which you can adapt that suits your needs.
3. templates to start a very basic Unicon project, which also can be enhanced easily. If you want to add your own template, just follow or edit the one I have.

Note: create template zip in the folder where the files are, not above that folder.

**Disclaimer: Use on your own risk!**


## Installation

This is a bit tricky, because I can not forsee what your system preferences are, so you have to find out yourself. Below are the usual location to put data. It's your $HOME/.local/share directory.

Install templates *make.zip or *.gz files in:
$HOME/.local/share/kdevappwizard/templates

Install file templates icn*.zip or *.gz files in:
$HOME/.local/share/kdevfiletemplates/templates

Install code snippets *.xml in:
$HOME/.local/share/ktexteditor_snippets/data

Install syntax highlighting unicon.xml in:
$HOME/.local/share/org.kde.syntax-highlighting/syntax


Hope that this might be usefull for others.
