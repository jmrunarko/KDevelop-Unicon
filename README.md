Unicon is a programming language which IMO I found a lot easier to read and write. 

I do C, C++, Fortran and Python. It has 2D, 3D Graphics Library. It has a lexx and yacc of it's own, socket library and so on.

You can find more information about Unicon on their website:

http://www.unicon.org/

They have many free books on their disposal.

This repo contains the templates and configuration for using Unicon in KDevelop/Kate.

Hope that it might be usefull for others.
If you want to add your own template, just follow or edit the one I have.

Note: create template zip in the folder where the files are, not above that folder.

Disclaimer: Use on your own risk!
